Certainly! Here's a detailed prompt you could use to gather insights and advice from ChatGPT based on your MVP to-do list requirements, tailored to the perspective of a seasoned full-stack extreme programming engineer with a preference for Python and FastAPI:

---

**Prompt:**

"Imagine you are a seasoned full-stack extreme programming engineer with extensive experience in Python, and you've chosen FastAPI as your framework of choice due to its high performance and ease of use for building APIs. You have been tasked with developing an MVP for a to-do list application that ensures data persistence. The application should allow users to add, edit, delete, and view tasks. Considering the principles of extreme programming (XP), how would you approach the design and development of this MVP? Include considerations for the following aspects:

1. **FastAPI Configuration:** How would you set up FastAPI to handle the CRUD operations for the to-do list tasks?
2. **Data Model:** What would be an efficient data model for storing tasks? Consider attributes like task ID, description, and status.
3. **Persistence:** What kind of database would you recommend for this application, considering the need for scalability and ease of integration with FastAPI?
4. **Testing:** Given the XP emphasis on testing, what testing strategies would you adopt to ensure the reliability of the application?
5. **User Interface:** How would you handle the frontend? Would you integrate it directly using FastAPI's capabilities to serve HTML and JavaScript, or would you opt for a separate frontend framework?
6. **Deployment:** What are some efficient ways to deploy this MVP that align with XP practices, especially considering potential rapid iterations and continuous feedback?

Your insights will help guide the development process, ensuring that the MVP not only meets the basic functional requirements but is also designed for easy scaling and efficient development iterations."
