Hello, as a seasoned full-stack engineer with a strong foundation in extreme programming, I am currently embarking on designing and implementing a to-do list application with a focus on data persistence. My preferred programming language is Python, known for its readability and broad applicability from scripting to web applications.

Here are the specifics and challenges of the project:

1. **User Experience Requirements**: The UI should be intuitive and responsive, capable of operating smoothly on both desktop and mobile platforms.
2. **Persistence Requirements**: Essential to this application is robust data persistence â€” users must be able to add, edit, delete, and retrieve tasks effectively. The persistence layer should cater to scalability as user numbers increase.
3. **Preferred Stack**: Given my preference for Python, I'm considering a Python-based backend. I'm open to suggestions for frameworks that best support rapid development and ease of maintenance, particularly in a Python-centric ecosystem.
4. **Scalability and Maintenance Concerns**: The solution must efficiently manage a scaling user base without degradation in performance.
5. **Security Considerations**: Handling user data securely is paramount. What are the best practices and tools within the Python ecosystem to ensure data integrity and security?

Based on these requirements, could you recommend a suitable database and a set of Python frameworks or libraries for both backend and potentially the frontend? What challenges might I face with this setup, and how should I address them to maintain the system's reliability and security?

Thank you for your guidance!
