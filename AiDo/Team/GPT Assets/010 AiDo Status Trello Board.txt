## Description

**Title**: Initial Setup of the AiDo Application

**Business Value**: This epic establishes the foundational infrastructure for AiDo, enabling further development and iteration. It ensures that the application is deployable, testable, and maintainable from the start, providing a robust base for future features and improvements.

**Problem**: The AiDo application requires a basic yet functional setup that includes both the frontend and backend systems, allowing communication through a simple endpoint. Additionally, the application must be accessible remotely and have a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

**Description**: This epic involves creating a walking skeleton for the AiDo application, including setting up a vanilla Next.js frontend and a FastAPI backend. The frontend will communicate with the backend using an unauthenticated "Hello World" endpoint. The application will be deployed to a cloud provider to ensure remote accessibility. A CI/CD pipeline will be implemented to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **Frontend Setup**:
   - **Given** a vanilla Next.js application,
   - **When** I run `npm run dev`,
   - **Then** I should see a default Next.js welcome page.
2. **Backend Setup**:
   - **Given** a FastAPI application with a "Hello World" endpoint,
   - **When** I access the endpoint via a browser or HTTP client,
   - **Then** I should receive a "Hello World" response.
3. **Frontend-Backend Communication**:
   - **Given** the Next.js frontend,
   - **When** it sends a request to the FastAPI backend,
   - **Then** it should receive the "Hello World" response.
4. **Deployment**:
   - **Given** the frontend and backend applications,
   - **When** they are deployed to a cloud provider,
   - **Then** they should be accessible via a public URL.
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - **Given** the source code in a version control system,
   - **When** changes are pushed to the repository,
   - **Then** the CI/CD pipeline should automatically build, test, and deploy the application.

###### User Stories

1. **As a developer, I want to set up a vanilla Next.js application so that I can build the frontend of AiDo.**
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:

     - **When** I deploy it to a cloud provider,
     - **Then** it should be accessible via a public URL.
5. **As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment processes so that development is streamlined.**
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - **Given** a version control repository,
     - **When** code is pushed,
     - **Then** the CI/CD pipeline should build, test, and deploy the application automatically.

###### Tasks

1. **Setup Next.js Application**:
   - Initialize a new Next.js project.
   - Verify that the project runs locally.
2. **Setup FastAPI Application**:
   - Initialize a new FastAPI project.
   - Implement a "Hello World" endpoint.

   - Verify remote accessibility.
5. **Setup CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Configure the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
   - Ensure the pipeline runs tests and deploys the application on code push.

###### Implementation Plan

1. **Day 1**: Setup vanilla Next.js and FastAPI applications. Verify local setups.
2. **Day 2**: Implement frontend-backend communication. Test and verify locally.
3. **Day 3**: Deploy both frontend and backend to the chosen cloud provider. Verify remote access.
4. **Day 4**: Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated build, test, and deployment. Verify the pipeline works as expected.

###### Comprehensive Guide: Spiking Out Access to a Trello Board Using `py-trello-api` and `python-dotenv`

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up Trello API access, install necessary Python packages, securely manage your credentials, and use the `py-trello-api` library to interact with Trello. Additionally, we'll note the deprecation of the `py-trello` library and the updates from the community.

###### Step-by-Step Instructions

###### Step 1: Register for Trello API Access

1. **Log in to Trello**:
   - Go to [Trello](https://trello.com/ "‌") and log in with your Trello account credentials.
2. **Access the Atlassian API Tokens Page**:
   - Visit the Atlassian API tokens page by navigating to [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens "‌").
3. **Create an API Token**:
   - Click on "Create API token".
   - Enter a memorable and concise label for your token in the dialog that appears.
   - Click "Create".
   - Click "Copy to clipboard" to copy the generated token. Save this token securely as it won't be displayed again after you close the dialog.
4. **Generate an API Key**:
   - To get an API key, you need to create a Trello Power-Up. Go to [Trello Power-Ups Admin Page](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin "‌").
   - Create a new Power-Up if you haven't already. Follow the instructions to set up your Power-Up.
   - Once your Power-Up is created, navigate to the API Key tab and select "Generate a new API Key". Copy this key.

###### Step 2: Install Necessary Python Packages

Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install py-trello-api python-dotenv
```

###### Step 3: Create a `.env` File for Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the same directory as your script and add your Trello API credentials to it:

```
TRELLO_API_KEY=your_api_key
TRELLO_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
```

Replace `your_api_key` and `your_api_token` with the actual values you copied in the previous steps.

###### Step 4: Write the Python Script to Authenticate and Fetch Data using `py-trello-api` and `python-dotenv`

Create a Python script named `trello_integration.py` that uses `py-trello-api` and `python-dotenv` to authenticate and fetch data from your Trello board.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from trello import TrelloClient

#### Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

TRELLO_API_KEY = os.getenv("TRELLO_API_KEY")
TRELLO_API_TOKEN = os.getenv("TRELLO_API_TOKEN")

def main():
    client = TrelloClient(
        api_key=TRELLO_API_KEY,
        api_secret=TRELLO_API_TOKEN,
    )

    # Get all boards
    boards = client.list_boards()
    print("Boards:")
    for board in boards:
        print(f"- {board.name} (ID: {board.id})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

###### Step 5: Run the Script

Run the script to authenticate and fetch data from your Trello board:

```bash
python trello_integration.py
```

###### Explanation of the Script

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - The script uses `python-dotenv` to load environment variables from a `.env` file, keeping sensitive information secure.
   - Replace `your_api_key` and `your_api_token` with your actual Trello credentials in the `.env` file.
2. **Authentication**:
   - The script uses the `TrelloClient` from the `py-trello-api` library to authenticate with Trello using the credentials loaded from the `.env` file.
3. **Fetching Boards**:
   - The `list_boards` method retrieves all the boards accessible by the authenticated user.
4. **Printing Board Details**:
   - The script prints the name and ID of each board for demonstration purposes.

###### Notes and Learnings from the Spike

1. **Deprecated** `py-trello` Library:
   - The `py-trello` library is no longer actively supported, which can lead to issues with compatibility and functionality.
2. **Community Fork** `py-trello-api`:
   - The community has forked the `py-trello` project, resulting in the `py-trello-api` package available on PyPI. This fork includes several pending updates and bug fixes from the original repository.
   - The `py-trello-api` package maintains an identical interface to `py-trello`, making it easy to transition.
3. **Package Installation**:
   - Ensure you install `py-trello-api` instead of `py-trello` using `pip install py-trello-api`.
4. **Environment Management**:
   - Using `python-dotenv` to manage environment variables helps keep sensitive information like API keys and tokens secure and out of your source code.

###### Conclusion

By following these steps and notes, you will set up Trello API access, manage your credentials securely with `python-dotenv`, and use the `py-trello-api` library to authenticate, fetch board details, and print information about your Trello boards. This approach simplifies the process of interacting with the Trello API and provides a more secure way to handle sensitive information.

Feel free to modify the script to fetch additional details, lists, and cards from your Trello boards as needed.
